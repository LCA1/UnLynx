# UnLynx [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/JoaoAndreSa/MedCo/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/JoaoAndreSa/MedCo?branch=master)
MedCo is a library for simulating a privacy-preserving data sharing tool. It offers a series of independent protocols that when combined offer a robust and safe way to share sensitive data (e.g., medical data).  

MedCo is developed by LCA1 (Laboratory for Communications and Applications from EPFL) as part of the MedCo project that aims to deploy a privacy-preserving software tool for sharing medical data.
