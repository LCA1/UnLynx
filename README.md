# UnLynx 
UnLynx is a library for simulating a privacy-preserving data sharing tool. It offers a series of independent protocols that when combined offer a verifiably-secure and safe way to share sensitive data (e.g., medical data).  

UnLynx is developed by LDS (Laboratory for Data Security in EPFL) in collaboration with DEDIS (Laboratory for Decentralized and Distributed Systems).  

## Documentation

* For further details and support, you can check the official [documentation](https://ldsec.gitbook.io/unlynx/).
* The UnLynx library does an intensive use of [Overlay-network (ONet) library](https://github.com/dedis/onet) and of the [Advanced Crypto (kyber) library](https://github.com/dedis/kyber).
* For more information regarding the underlying architecture please refer to the stable version of ONet `go.dedis.ch/onet/v3`.
* To check the code organisation, have a look at [Layout](https://app.gitbook.com/@ldsec/s/unlynx/layout).
* For more information on how to run our protocols, services, simulations and apps, go to [Running UnLynx](https://app.gitbook.com/@ldsec/s/unlynx/running-unlynx).
