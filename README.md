# UnLynx [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/LCA1/UnLynx/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/LCA1/UnLynx?branch=master)
UnLynx is a library for simulating a privacy-preserving data sharing tool. It offers a series of independent protocols that when combined offer a robust and safe way to share sensitive data (e.g., medical data).  

UnLynx is developed by LCA1 (Laboratory for Communications and Applications in EPFL) in collaboration with DeDis (Laboratory for Decentralized and Distributed Systems).  

## Documentation

* The UnLynx library does an intensive use of [Overlay-network (ONet) library](https://github.com/dedis/onet)
* For more information regarding the underlying architecture please refer to the stable version of ONet `gopkg.in/dedis/onet.v1`
* To check the code organisation, have a look at [Layout](https://github.com/LCA1/UnLynx/wiki/Layout)
* For more information on how to run our services, simulations and apps, go to [Running UnLynx](https://github.com/LCA1/UnLynx/wiki/Running-UnLynx)
